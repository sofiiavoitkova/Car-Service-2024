### üìç About the Project
RoadReady is a user-friendly, fully responsive platform designed to help users find, review, and explore car service options in Poland. Built with a robust tech stack, this web app delivers a seamless experience for users searching for local car services based on category, name, and location.

Users can register, log in, search by category, view detailed service information, and even get directions using integrated Google Maps. This project also includes onboarding tutorials to enhance user engagement and guide new users through core features.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Frontend**: [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) with [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) for UI components.
- **Backend**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for RESTful API development.
- **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) for schema-based data modeling.

### üöÄ Deployment
This project is set up for deployment on platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), ensuring it‚Äôs accessible and scalable.

### üíº Why This Project Stands Out
RoadReady showcases a modern tech stack combined with best practices in web development. Designed with scalability and user experience in mind, this project demonstrates practical skills in both frontend and backend development, including real-time data handling, secure user management, and third-party API integration.
